    <h2>Go, Nellie!</h2>

    <p>Go Nellie is BlueLight's first game, with an anticipated release date of April 2019.</p>
    <p>
        What is a princess to do in an ever-scrolling world full of danger? Run, of course!
        Princess Nellie wandered too far from her tour bus visiting planet Midnight, and has found
        herself lost in a nightmarish ever-changing maze of monsters and obstacles. Nellie must
        find her way back to the palace in one piece!
    </p>
    <p>
        To play Go Nellie, direct Nellie where to go with your cursor and press the space bar to jump.
        Pick up a variety of buffs to help along the journey, such as a shield to absorb damage, cake to
        recover health points, a make-small potion to help navigate the dangerous terrain, and more.
